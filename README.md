This is the implementation of the [Electronic Health Certificates (EHN) specification](https://github.com/ehn-digital-green-development/hcert-spec)
used to verify the validity of COVID Certificates [in Switzerland](https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCertificate-App-Android).

It is partially based on [these](https://github.com/ehn-digital-green-development/hcert-kotlin)
[two](https://github.com/DIGGSweden/dgc-java) implementations.

## Work in Progress

The CovidCertificate SDK for Android is work in progress and is not yet complete.
We are continuing the development of this library, and the API is likely to change.
